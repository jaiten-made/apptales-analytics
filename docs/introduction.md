# Introduction

## What is AppTales?

AppTales is a powerful product-driven analytics and path exploration tool designed to visualize and analyze how users navigate through your application. Unlike user-driven analytics that track individuals, AppTales focuses on understanding product flows and feature interactions. By integrating with GA4 (Google Analytics 4) and FullStory, AppTales automatically captures and displays anonymized product interaction patterns in an intuitive flowchart format.

## Core Functionality

### Automatic Event Capture

AppTales automatically captures two primary types of product events:

- **Page View Events**: Track which pages and features are accessed in your product
- **Click Element Events**: Monitor interactions with specific UI elements and features

### Interactive Flow Visualization

All captured events are automatically rendered as an interactive flowchart, allowing you to visualize product navigation flows and feature interaction patterns within your application.

### Bidirectional Path Exploration

The key feature of AppTales is its flexible path exploration system:

1. **Select a Starting Anchor**: Choose any event in your product flow as a reference point
2. **Explore Backwards**: View the events that occurred _before_ your selected anchor point
3. **Explore Forwards**: View the events that occurred _after_ your selected anchor point
4. **Configurable Depth**: Set the depth parameter (n) to control how many steps before or after to display

This bidirectional exploration allows you to understand both:

- What product paths lead to a specific feature or page
- What actions occur after reaching that point in the product

## Use Cases

- Identify drop-off points in product flows
- Understand common navigation paths leading to conversions
- Analyze product interaction patterns around specific features
- Optimize navigation and product experience based on actual usage patterns
- Debug product experience issues by examining event sequences
- Measure feature adoption and usage flows

## Getting Started

To begin using AppTales, connect your GA4 or FullStory account and start exploring the automatically generated flowcharts of your product navigation flows and feature interactions.
