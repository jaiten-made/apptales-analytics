# Introduction

## What is AppTales?

AppTales is a powerful analytics path exploration tool designed to visualize and analyze user journeys through your application. By integrating with GA4 (Google Analytics 4) and FullStory, AppTales automatically captures and displays user behavior in an intuitive flowchart format.

## Core Functionality

### Automatic Event Capture

AppTales automatically captures two primary types of user events:

- **Page View Events**: Track which pages users visit throughout their journey
- **Click Element Events**: Monitor user interactions with specific UI elements

### Interactive Flow Visualization

All captured events are automatically rendered as an interactive flowchart, allowing you to visualize the complete user journey through your application.

### Bidirectional Path Exploration

The key feature of AppTales is its flexible path exploration system:

1. **Select a Starting Anchor**: Choose any event in your user journey as a reference point
2. **Explore Backwards**: View the events that occurred _before_ your selected anchor point
3. **Explore Forwards**: View the events that occurred _after_ your selected anchor point
4. **Configurable Depth**: Set the depth parameter (n) to control how many steps before or after to display

This bidirectional exploration allows you to understand both:

- What led users to a specific point in their journey
- What actions users took after reaching that point

## Use Cases

- Identify drop-off points in user flows
- Understand common paths leading to conversions
- Analyze user behavior patterns around specific features
- Optimize navigation and user experience based on actual usage data
- Debug user experience issues by examining event sequences

## Getting Started

To begin using AppTales, connect your GA4 or FullStory account and start exploring the automatically generated flowcharts of your user journeys.
