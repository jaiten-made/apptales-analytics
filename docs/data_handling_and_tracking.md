# Data Handling and Tracking

## Overview

In this document, we address the safety concerns regarding data handling and tracking within our application. It is crucial to ensure that user data is managed securely and transparently.

## Data Handling

1. **Data Storage**: We store customer emails for authentication and communication purposes. Users can opt out of communication at any time. Since we do not retain personal data beyond emails, encryption is not required.

2. **Data Processing**: Data is processed in compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR). We ensure that data is anonymized where possible to protect user identities.

3. **Data Retention**: We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose. Users can request data deletion at any time.

## Tracking Mechanisms

1. **Product Interaction Tracking**: We monitor aggregated product interactions to understand how product features perform and where users encounter friction. Our tracking focuses on product signals such as:
   - Page views
   - Element clicks
   - Feature usage
     These metrics are analyzed to evaluate user flows, conversion funnels, and feature adoption, guiding product improvements rather than profiling individuals. Data is collected and processed as anonymized, event-level metrics; no personal identifiers are captured or retained.

## Conclusion

We take data handling and tracking seriously, implementing robust measures to ensure user safety and compliance with regulations. Users are encouraged to reach out with any concerns or questions regarding their data.
