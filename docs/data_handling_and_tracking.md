# Data Handling and Tracking

## Overview

In this document, we address the safety concerns regarding data handling and tracking within our application. It is crucial to ensure that user data is managed securely and transparently.

## Data Handling

1. **Data Storage**: We store customer emails for authentication and communication purposes. Users can opt out of communication at any time. Since we do not retain personal data beyond emails, encryption is not required.

2. **Data Processing**: Data is processed in compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR). We ensure that data is anonymized where possible to protect user identities.

3. **Data Retention**: We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose. Users can request data deletion at any time.

## Tracking Mechanisms

1. **Product-Driven Analytics**: AppTales focuses exclusively on product-driven analytics, not user-driven analytics. We track product interactions to understand how features perform and where friction occurs in your product experience. Our tracking captures product signals such as:
   - Page views (which pages/features are accessed)
   - Element clicks (how UI elements are used)
   - Feature usage patterns (adoption and flow sequences)

   These metrics are analyzed to evaluate product flows, conversion funnels, and feature performance—not to profile or identify individual users. Data is collected and processed as anonymized, event-level metrics with no personal identifiers captured or retained. The focus is entirely on understanding product behavior, not user identity.

## Conclusion

We take data handling and tracking seriously, implementing robust measures to ensure user safety and compliance with regulations. Users are encouraged to reach out with any concerns or questions regarding their data.
